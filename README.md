## Contribution Guide

### Installation
Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- If on mac, I recommend using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Clone https://github.com/Yu266426/pygbase.git into a directory.
- This is the engine used extensively throughout this project

In the same repository, clone https://github.com/Yu266426/CatacombsOfTime.git.

Go into `CatacombsOfTime`, and do `uv run main.py` in CLI.

### Development
Activating virtual environment:
- Mac/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`

If there are problems with `pygbase`, make sure that the correct virtual environment is selected.
